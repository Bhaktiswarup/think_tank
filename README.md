## Usage

### Creating Agents

To create a new AI agent, use the following command:

```python
agent = Agent(name="Researcher", capabilities=["research", "data analysis"])
```

You can customize the agent's capabilities based on your needs. Once created, agents can collaborate with each other.

### Collaborating with Agents

Agents can communicate and share insights through a simple API. Use the following method to send messages between agents:

```python
agent1.send_message(agent2, "What are the latest trends in AI?")
```

### Storing Results

To store results in Notion, use the Notion integration functions. For example:

```python
notion_client.create_page(title="AI Trends", content=results)
```

This function will create a new page in your Notion workspace with the specified title and content.
